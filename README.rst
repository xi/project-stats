project-stats can be used to keep track of all the projects you are involved
in.  It collects data from several on- and offline data sources (e.g. git,
github, pypi, bower) and combines them in a short report.

installation
------------

::

   pip install project-stats

configuration
-------------

See ``sample.yml``.

The configuration is expected in ``./projects.yml``, ``./.projects.yml``,
``~/.config/projects.yml``, or ``~/.projects.yml``. The path can also be
explicitly specified with ``-c``/``--config``.

command line arguments
----------------------

See ``project-stats -h``
